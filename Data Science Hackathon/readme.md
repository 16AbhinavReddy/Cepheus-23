# Data Science Hackathon #

This is a 84 hrs Data Science Hackathon which I have conducted for the fest where in you are expected to use your data science skills to help save a planet from the problems which they are facing. <br>

Here are the links which will direct you to the competition pages of both problem statements.
<li>
  <strong>PS - I</strong> : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cepheus-23-data-science-hackathon-ps-i 
<li>
  <strong>PS - II</strong> : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cepheus-23-data-science-hackathon-ps-ii

Due to the maximum limit 100 MB usage in a GitHub repository, I haven't uploaded data files for the 2nd problem statement. You can access it from the competition page.
