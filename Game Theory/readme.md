# Game Theory

This is an offline event where in you will be a part of a game show where in you are expected to qualify for the nest round based on the strategies and decisions made by your teammates. <br>

Here's the story line up which we developed for the purpose of the event.

For getting selected for the Armada-7 mission, participants need to have certain skills. And to check whether the participants have those skills or not, they will be tested by sending them on a space mission where they have to retrieve two main resources (<strong>Indestructium</strong> and <strong>Precisium</strong>) for which they have to travel to a place called <strong>The Valuable Vale</strong> in a spaceship. Only those who succeed in this mission will be selected for the Armada-7 mission. As this mission has a very high risk of death and the valuable collectible is important for the nation’s progress and future, the stakes are very high, so those who return back after completing the mission will get a good amount of money as reward and various other facilities. <br>

## Mission-1 (Conquer the Spaceship):

Unfortunately, the main council who are handling these crew members for testing their skills thought that they don’t have enough capacity on the spaceship to send all these 40 members to go to The Valuable Vale. So, they decided that only those members with better combat skills will be sent to this mission. This led to dividing the crew members into two teams and they decided that only one team out of both will be sent to the mission. Here comes the first task in the mission.

They will be provided with three spaceships named <strong>Galactic Explorer</strong>, <strong>Cosmic Navigator</strong> and <strong>Nova Voyager</strong> in three spaceship stands. Out of these 3, Cosmic Navigator is the better ranked spaceship among the two and Nova Voyager is the next better ranked one. Now both these teams will arrange a meeting and they decide to take control over as many spaceships as possible. So, they decide to split into 3 teams where each team tries to get control over a spaceship. These team members will agree on one condition. Once a team gets control over a spaceship, they will help their other teammates to get over the other spaceship and travel for the further mission. [The logic behind this is based on the points both teams earned only the team with higher points will be selected]. Council members also decided to give access to these spaceship stands to both teams as they thought that their combat skills could be tested here itself.

After the 1st round, the main council members handling this operation will decide that there are few members in the losing team who are talented and worth taking. Also, there is capacity in the spaceship to take 10 other members. So, the council members have decided to provide another chance to these 20 members to prove their worth. So, these 20 members are again divided into 10 members and these both teams now fight for the same spaceships as before.

Finally 30 members are sent over these three spaceships.

## Mission-2 (Money Mavericks):

Now these 30 members get onboard and travel to The Valuable Vale. During the course of the journey, they require money to buy food and some other valuables required. So, these 30 members have to visit this place which is a mysterious and ancient temple where a legendary treasure is said to be hidden. So, they go to this place. When they enter the temple, suddenly each crew member gets separated from each other and all are locked up. For a minute, all these crew members suddenly get tensed up. Then a character named <strong>Cash Crusader</strong> appears who is dressed up in some queen fashion. She is the one who rules this temple. Cash Crusader informs each and every member that they need to choose one among 15 treasure boxes in 75 seconds. He Also informs that if the other members choose the same prize, then the treasure is distributed among these members. They will be provided with 3 chances like this and they need to collect the amount they received at each chance. But there is one thing which each member needs to take note of. Only top 15 richer members out of 30 members will be released from the temple and remaining 15 members will be executed. Now each member gets stuck in this temple. So, they don’t have any other option to escape. They have to play the game. 
So, they play the game and only 15 members are released from this temple and the remaining people are executed. 

## Mission-3 (Galaxy of Pirates):

Now these remaining crew members travel in space. Then these spaceships enters a region where there is an invasion of space pirates, as they were informed before only that they might need to fight space pirates. Due to their fighting skills, their choice of weapons and the training/suggestions that the crew received after they were selected, they are able to defeat the space pirates without any harm to the crew. After fighting the space pirates and finding the collectible, they find that while they were fighting with space pirates, some of the space pirates had reached the food storage section in the ship and damaged the food resources, but some food resources till remain, which were left for emergency situations in a different compartment, but that was sufficient for only 6 participants to survive the return journey. So they all mutually decide that they will divide themselves in 3 groups of 5 each. They will play the game of pirate distribution and then the top 6 will remain on the plane while all the rest will die. During the course of the journey, the crew had already made 3 groups of 5. 

In this game, players will be split into 3 groups, and a CAPTAIN will be selected randomly from each group. The CAPTAIN will have the authority to divide the share while the other members can either accept or neglect it. The captain will either be permitted to continue the game or ousted depending on the member's choice. A certain number of rounds will be played and the CAPTAIN will be chosen randomly for each round. In the end, the player with the maximum points from each group will level up to the next game.

So finally 6 members are left in the crew and they travel to The Valuable Vale.

## Mission-4 (Galactic Rescue) :

Now these 6 members finally reach the place The Valuable Vale where many valuable resources are held. The task given to these members was to bring two valuable resources named <strong>Indestructium</strong> and <strong>Precisium</strong> which can be used to make necessary materials and weapons in the actual Armada-7 mission. Precisium can be used to make weapons and guns more sharp and precise. Indestructium is one of the strongest metals in the whole cepheus universe which can be used to make weapons and things which cannot be destroyed and make weapons much stronger. Based on the quantity of these two resources which they bring, these 6 members will be given a position ranked from 1 to 6 for the actual Armada-7 mission. This rank is calculated based on the <strong>valuable score</strong> {No. of keygens * Quantity of Indestructium (in gms)} (Info about keygens will be provided later). When they go to this place, they will meet the Queen of the city, The Star Seeker. Now these 6 members will request to help them by providing these two resources for their actual Armada-7 mission. The star seeker accepts and provides 14 keygens to each of these 6 members. These keygens are made up of Precisium. But the star seeker offers a choice to each of them. Using these keygens, they need to enter the main core of the valuable vale city where they can find the metal resource Indestructium. This core can be assumed to be something like a big 6 x 3 station maze where each station contains 10 rooms which contain Indestructium metal. Members need to use these keygens as keys to open the stations as well as to each door to a room. But once a member uses one keygen, he won’t get that keygen back. Also if a member chooses another room then the previously opened room of that participant will be locked up. So based on the amount of Indestructium in each room, each member needs to think smartly and choose with how many keygens and Indestructium he needs to leave at the end in order to get a higher position in the Armada-7 mission. 

All crew members now bring these resources. Based on the amount of resources they brought, each one of them is ranked with a certain level of position.
