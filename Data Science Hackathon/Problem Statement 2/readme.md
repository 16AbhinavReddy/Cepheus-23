# Problem Statement

Uavis, the AI available across the entire Cepheusverse has a special ability to transfer asteroids across the Universe to the planets which can be turned into useful resources to make food/water/air. But if it has the information that a planet is evil, then instead of these useful asteroids the potentially hazardous asteroids will be bombarded upon that planet. They will lead to the release of harmful gasses and some unknown chemicals. If the composition of chemicals reaches a certain level in the atmosphere, the planet will be in ruin as it will lead to severe effects like the destruction of its moons, weakening gravity and decaying life. Finally it will have no atmosphere and it will become a dead planet. Mu-Phei is one of the dead planets in the Cepheus Verse. Uavis went rogue and it bombed these hazardous asteroids on these planets.

With all the previous data of these asteroids, participants need to create an ML model which will calculate the Hazard rate of these asteroids. Hazard rate is the measure of how hazardous an asteroid is. Based on the train data we provide, participants will have to predict the Hazard rate of different asteroids.
